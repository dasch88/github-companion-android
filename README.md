# github-companion-android
Simple startup Android app that allows the user to login to GitHub via basic authentication, and view GitHub data. Set up as an enterprise application, using with external Java library for business code and dependency injection.

This is just the beginning of a mini enterprise-style android application still under development. This is an Android Studio project that uses basic authentication to log in the user via a GitHub account. It uses Retrofit for external (GitHub) service calls and Dagger for compile-time dependency injection. 

The goal is to build out the application to display the user's GitHub repositories and some detail pages that will also serve as practice for me getting used to the Android paradigm. The eventual intention is to also release iOS and Windows Phone versions of the same project for comparison and introductory purposes. Feel free to submit pull requests, but don't be surprised if they aren't considered much--since this is a practice for myself after all. :) If you think it will help, though, I welcome it! Thanks!
